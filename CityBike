With this project i'm practicing utilizing a CTE to help define my query and exploring window functions


CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.CityBikeLanes (
id integer primary key,
year_installed year not null,
year_updated year not null,
street varchar not null,
width_feet integer not null,
safetyrating integer not null,
protected varchar not null);



#1.list of all the bike lanes that have an average safety rating of 4.0 or higher, and create a label that says "Safe Lane".

WITH safety_average_CTE AS (
SELECT street, AVG(safetyrating) AS rating
FROM CityBikeLanes
GROUP BY street)

SELECT street,rating, 'safe lane' AS 'label'
FROM safety_average_CTE
WHERE rating >=4

#2. Using a windows function to find the average safety rating for each indidvual street.
SELECT street, safetyrating,
AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) as "Average_safety_rating"
FROM CityBikeLanes

#3.list of all the bike lanes, both safety ratings for each lane, the average safety rating for each lane, and a label with the recommendation as "Remove", "Leave As-Is", or "Improvements Needed".
SELECT street, safetyrating,
AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) as "Average_safety_rating",
CASE WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) >=4 THEN "Leave As-Is"
    WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) <2.5 THEN "Remove"
    ELSE "Improvements Needed"
    END AS "Recommendation"
FROM CityBikeLanes
